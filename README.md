# Restaurant App

I used React and its related techniques a lot in this project.

## Build with
- React
- Chakra UI
- React Context API
- react router dom
- Firebase
- Formik
- Yup

All design credits go to [Bootstrap Made](https://bootstrapmade.com/demo/Yummy/)

Data Fetching from free api is no longer reliable.  
So that I made [Api](https://github.com/shinehtetnaing/mock-steak-data-api) by myself.  
but there was still a need for knowledge, so I used Firebase to build a data collection in Firestore.  

>still need to figure out how image loading performance can be increased from external image URL.

### Next Steps

- build Login and Register UIs
- new features (eg. payment form ui after checkout, pagination for menu)
- make better SEO (social media card)
